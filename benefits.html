										Members have the opportunity to apply to the 20 officer positions available at the UCSD CA Psi chapter of Tau Beta Pi. This is an excellent opportunity to become more involved in the engineering community and encourage professional development. Officers work extensively with other engineering orgs throughout the year, in addition to external involvement with TBP headquarters.

In addition, please feel free to contact any of the officers if you have interest in joining a committee.
