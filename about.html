							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The UC San Diego chapter of TBP works to create and network a community of engineers across all departments and majors. Our goal is to help our members grow into well-rounded engineers who honor their Alma Mater. We host many professional development workshops as well as engineering industry info sessions to prepare our members for their futures. We also hold many community service events, our most notable being the weekly trips to Florence Elementary School to introduce science and engineering topics to 4th and 5th graders, to promote interest in STEM fields. Lastly, our chapter hosts social events for our members to meet and bond with each other. The majority of members have had lasting friendships beyond their college years, which were forged in Tau Beta Pi.</p>

									<h2>The Bent</h2>
									<p>The official badge of the Association is a watch key in the form of the bent of a trestle, engraved on the reverse side with the member's name, chapter, and class. The word key describes the insignia of many organizations. It comes from the fact that it was first designed to, in the late eighteenth century, to include a pocketwatch winding feature, hence key. The bottom stem, added to the basic insignia, had a tapered square hole fitting the common sizes of watch-winding shafts. The top stem and ring were added so that the key could be worn as a pendant from a chain, rather than as a pin or badge, thus easily used to wind watches. The stem-winder watch was introduced in the late nineteenth century, it replaced the key-winder. But the insignia key remained, although with a vestigial hole now round for manufacturing ease and economy. On February 21, 2001 TBP â€“ CA Psi erected its Bent statue outside EBU I.

									<h2>Our Accomplishments</h2>
									<p>The California Psi Chapter at UC San Diego was established in 1994. Currently at about 80 current undergraduate members and over 1,300 alumni members, both the size of membership and activities over the past several years has increased dramatically. In both 2006-2007 and 2009-2010, the California Psi chapter was selected from the 234 and 236 active Tau Beta Pi chapters, respectively, to be honored with the R. C. Matthews Most Outstanding Chapter Award. This award recognizes high-grade work by chapters in both routine and special affairs. The award is based on how well chapter service projects fulfill the objectives of Tau Beta Pi and on the quality and promptness of chapter reports to the Headquarters.This is quite an accomplishment and we intend to maintain these high standards in all of our work this school year.
