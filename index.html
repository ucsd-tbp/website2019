							<h1>Tau Beta Pi, California Psi</h1>
							<h3>The Premier Engineering Honor Society at UCSD</h3>

We focus on serving our members and the public with enthusiasm and distinction, and strive to promote excellence in engineering.</p>

									<h2>Eligiblility</h2>
									<p>The UC San Diego Chapter of Tau Beta Pi conducts two Initiations per academic year. Invitations to eligible students are mailed out during Weeks 3 and 4 of the Fall and Winter academic quarters to students in the <strong>top 1/8th of the Junior class</strong> and <strong>top 1/5th of the Senior class</strong>. For students to have Junior Class standing, they must have completed 90-135 units. To qualify for Senior Class standing, students must have completed over 135 units. In addition, students must have attended UCSD for at least one full academic year. </p>

									<h2>Initiation</h2>
									<p>After invitations are sent out, info sessions are held for the the invited students to inform them about the initiation process to become a member. During the Initiation Cycle (approximately a 10 week period), we look for two main things when electing new members into TBP. The first is academic excellence, which all of you have obviously attained. The second, and perhaps the more important of the two, is outstanding character. In order to better judge this, we would like to get to know you better. Thus, we ask that you submit a candidate packet with some information about yourself, as well as participate in events with our members. After reviewing your packets, we will conduct individual interviews. At this point, we will invite those people who we feel exemplify the qualities we are looking for to initiate into TBP. </p>

									<h3>Professional and Academic Events</h3>
									<p>We hold industry info sessions, professional development workshops, and mixers with professors from the engineering
										departments. Companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, Northrop Grumman, and NuVasive have come to host events with us for
										our members and candidates. Additionally, we hold resume critiques to help our candidates and members get their
										dream positions.</p>

									<h3>Social Events</h3>

									<h3>Community Service and Outreach</h3>
									<p>Every week, our chapter sends a few members to go to our local Florence Elementary School to do a fun
										STEM activity to get their hands dirty. Come make an impact and inspire a student to pursue engineering! We also
										go to the San Diego Food Bank, participate in River Clean-Ups, and even go to orphanages in Tijuana to do a full
										day's worth of science experiments with the kids.</p>
