							<p>The UC San Diego Chapter of Tau Beta Pi conducts two Initiations per academic year. Invitations to eligible students are mailed out during Weeks 3 and 4 of the Fall and Winter academic quarters to students in the <strong>top 1/8th of the Junior class</strong> and <strong>top 1/5th of the Senior class</strong>. For students to have Junior Class standing, they must have completed 90-135 units. To qualify for Senior Class standing, students must have completed over 135 units. In addition, students must have attended UCSD for at least one full academic year.</p>
							<p>After invitations are sent out, info sessions are held for the the invited students to inform them about the initiation process to become a member. During the Initiation Cycle (approximately a 10 week period), we look for two main things when electing new members into TBP. The first is academic excellence, which all of you have obviously attained. The second, and perhaps the more important of the two, is outstanding character. In order to better judge this, we would like to get to know you better. Thus, we ask that you submit a candidate packet with some information about yourself, as well as participate in events with our members. After reviewing your packets, we will conduct individual interviews. At this point, we will invite those people who we feel exemplify the qualities we are looking for to initiate into TBP.</p>
							<p><strong>Once you initiate, you are a lifetime member.</strong> lIf you continue to come to UCSD's Tau Beta Pi events and retain active membership, you will be eligible for chapter benefits.</p>
